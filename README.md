## Skye Kychenthal! :)

I am a trans-feminine non-binary jack-of-all-trades video-essayist, editor, photographer, poet, TikToker, model, programmer, sysadmin (unfortunate), researcher, and much, much more located in Portland, Oregon. You can find my links at [skymochi64.gay](https://www.skymochi64.gay)

You can find me under one of three aliases:

* SkyMocha (SFW)
* SkyMochi64 (SFW)
* SkyMochi256 (NSFW)

I graduated from The Peddie School in 2022. Since then, I have tried many things. Among the things I decided were not for me is college. I currently work as a video editor for [Nominal.Naomi](https://www.tiktok.com/@nominal.naomi), run an OnlyFans account, engage in local activism, and create entertainment & educational content on YouTube and TikTok.

My development foci are FullStack & GameDev. You can find my list of publications & major projects at https://www.skyekychenthal.com/publications
