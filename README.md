## About me

I am a trans-feminine non-binary jack-of-all-trades video-essayist, editor, photographer, poet, TikToker, model, programmer, sysadmin (unfortunate), researcher, and much, much more located in Portland, Oregon. You can find my links at [skymochi64.gay](https://www.skymochi64.gay). I am also the head of [The Blahaj Research Intitute for Transgender Research](https://github.com/Blahaj-Research-Institute/).

I graduated from The Peddie School in 2022. Since then, I have become an esteemed colleeg dropout. I currently work as a video editor for [Nominal.Naomi](https://www.tiktok.com/@nominal.naomi), run an OnlyFans account, and create entertainment & educational content on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok.

I used to focus my code on FullStack and GameDev, however now adays I code priamrily for utility within managing my daily workflows or engaging in research.

Thanks for taking a look ♥️
