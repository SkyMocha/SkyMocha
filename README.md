# Heya! :)

My name is Skye, but I'm also known as SkyMocha! I am a content creator on the channel [SkyMocha](https://www.youtube.com/c/NickStudiosCode), and an independent developer. 

I primarily focus on Full-stack and GameDev.

You can find my portoflio on [SkyMocha.net](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/), or a entire list of projects can be found on this Github!

My resume can also be found [here](https://www.skymocha.net/resume.pdf)!

Thanks for taking a look ♥️
