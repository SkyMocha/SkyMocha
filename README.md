## Heya! :)

My name is Skye, but I'm also known online as SkyMocha! I go by they/she pronouns and am currently a senior @ The Peddie School and this fall will be a Freshmen @ Reed College. I work primarily as a content creator on the channel [SkyMocha](https://www.youtube.com/c/NickStudiosCode) and as an independent developer. 

My development foci are FullStack & GameDev.

You can find my portoflio on [SkyMocha.net](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/), or a entire list of projects can be found on this Github!

My resume can also be found [here](https://www.skymocha.net/resume.pdf)!
